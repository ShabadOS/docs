title: Importing an overlay theme
---

It is possible to create overlay themes to match your brand or custom styling. Users may export/save custom overlay themes using the online [Theme Tool](https://themes.shabados.com/). People may also create custom overlay themes and send/attach the CSS file to others, in which case they will need to learn how to import it to their local Shabad OS Presenter app.

## Opening the folder location of Shabad OS overlay themes

1. In the Shabad OS controller, click the cog/gear to open the **Settings** window.
2. Select **Overlay** in the left pane.
3. Click **Open Overlay Folder**.

## Adding custom overlay themes to Shabad OS

1. Locate the custom overlay theme (e.g. a file exported/saved from the online [Theme Tool](https://themes.shabados.com/) that ends in a `.css` file extension).
2. Move the custom overlay theme into the folder location of Shabad OS overlay themes.

## Selecting the custom overlay theme

1. Open the **Settings** window in Shabad OS.
2. Confirm that **Overlay** is selected in the left pane.
3. Click the **Overlay Name** dropdown menu.
4. Select the line matching the filename of the custom overlay theme.

:::note
You may have to refresh web browsers that were already pointing to the overlay for the theme to take effect. For example, in **OBS** you may have to **Right-Click the Browser Source** and click **Properties** and scroll down to **Refresh cache of current page** for the custom Overlay theme to take effect.
