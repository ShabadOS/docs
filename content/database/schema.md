This section describes the structure and schema of the database, in-depth.

The sheer volume of content within the schema may be overwhelming at first, however is structured to provide as much consistency, accuracy, and flexibility as possible.

## Diagram

The SQL schema can be seen below:

### Lines

The [Lines](#Lines) table contains all the Gurbani content, across all sources.

Many lines must belong to one [Shabad](#Shabad).

The content is unordered by default, and must be ordered by `order_id`.
The `id` is a four-letter, immutable identifier that will refer to the same line across database versions.

Currently, the `gurmukhi` stores as an ASCII representation of Gurbani. We are hoping to upgrade this to Unicode eventually.

| Column                    | Type    | Description                                                                                               | Constraints                                         |

### Sources

The [Sources](#Sources) table provides a list of all the different source of Gurbani that the database contains. E.g. `SGPC`, `Budha Dal Mehron`.

Sometimes, [sources](#Sources) may overlap for the same [Line](#Lines), since it is possible for the same line to vary slightly.

This is useful for selecting which Gurbani source that a [Line](#Lines) will be displayed from.

| Column        | Type    | Description                                                | Constraints |

| name_gurmukhi | text    | The name of the source, in Gurmukhi, ASCII representation. | Not Null    |
|               |

### Line_Content

The [Line_Content](#Line_Content) table contains the corresponding gurmukhi for a [Line](#Lines) for a [Source](#Sources).

This exists to support the differences between Sources of Gurbani for the same lines.

| Column        | Type    | Description                                                                                               | Constraints                                          |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| line_id       | char(4) | The 4 letter unique identifier of the Gurbani line that the transliteration corresponds with.             | Primary Key, <br/> Foreign Key ([Lines](#Lines).id)  |
| source_id     | integer | The unique identifier of the gurbani source for the line.                                                 | Primary, <br/> Foreign Key ([Sources](#Sources)) Key |
| gurmukhi      | text    | The Gurbani line, stored as an ASCII representation of Gurmukhi.                                          | Not Null                                             |
| first_letters | text    | The first letters of each word in the `gurmukhi` line, useful for searching the database by first letter. | Not Null                                             |

### Line_Types

The [Line_Types](#Line_Types) table contains the possible classifications of each [line](#Lines).

This can be useful for filtering out `rahao` lines from searches, or reordering the `manglacharan` if desired.

:::note
Currently, this table is yet to be populated.

Every Shabad must have a [composition](#Compositions), [writer](#Writer), and [section](#Section).

The content is unordered by default, and must be ordered by `order_id`.
The `id` is a three-letter, immutable identifier that will refer to the same Sahbad across database versions.

### Translation_Sources

The [Translation_Sources](#Translation_Sources) table contains all the sources of translations that the database contains, used by the [Translations](#Translations).

A translation source is a combination of the Gurbani [source](#Sources), the [language](#Languages), and the author details.

To retrieve the actual [Translations](#Translations) for a translation source, use the [Translations](#Translations) table.

| Column         | Type    | Description                                                                                                   | Constraints                                                    |

The [Translations](#Translations) table contains the corresponding translation of a single line from a [translation source](#Translation_Sources).

Note that the `translation` can be nullable.

If used, the `additional_information` is a serialised JSON string that must be deserialised with a `JSON.parse()` or equivalent, to support non-standard fields universally across different translation sources.

| Column                 | Type      | Description                                                                                                   | Constraints                                                                     |

| additional_information | text/json | Any additional, non-standard data about the translation. Stored as a serialised JSON object.                  | None                                                                            |

### Banis

A Bani is a collection of [Lines](#Lines). The [Banis](#Banis) table provides a list of all the Banis tht the database contains.

To retrieve the actual [Lines](#Lines) within a Bani, use the [Bani_Lines](#Bani_Lines) table.

### Bani_Lines

The [Bani_Lines](#Bani_Lines) table connects one [Bani](#Banis) to many [Lines](#Lines).

:::note
The `line_group` field is slightly more complicated, as it orders collections of [lines](#Lines), but not the [lines](#Lines) themselves.
