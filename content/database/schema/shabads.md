title: Shabads
---

The `Shabads` table is used to group the [`Lines`](lines) together, and provide additional metadata about those [`Lines`](lines).

Every Shabad must have a [`composition`](compositions), [`writer`](writer), and [`section`](section).

The content is unordered by default, and must be ordered by `order_id`.

The `id` is a three-letter, immutable identifier that will refer to the same Shabad across database versions.
